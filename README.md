zchess-java
===========

Just putting up this old chess program, as it is perhaps of some historical value.

This was made as a class project for my 10th grade AP Computer Science class, in 2004. Or maybe I did it on the side with all the free time I had in that class, I don't know.

It's rather crappy code, with not-so-great coding style. It tries to use primitives a lot for speed (mainly ints).

I think there are bugs in it, judging by the old logfile I have from it. I haven't run it in a long time, and I don't even have Java on this machine, so yeah.

It's mostly a GUI program, but it has console output for engine info.

The AI uses a pretty standard alpha/beta search with a basic evaluation. I can't imagine the strength is more than 1800 or so, even if you were to get rid of the bugs.
